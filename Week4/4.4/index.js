// POSTMAN
// Postman makes it easy to test, develop and document APIs by allowing users to quickly put together both simple and complex HTTP requests. Postman can be use as a chrome package app or add-on.

// Authorization - verifies whether you have permission to access the data you want from the server.
// When you send a request you often have to include parameters to ensure the request has permission to access and return the data you want.

// If you don't specify authorization it will always be "Inherit auth from parent"
// No Auth - anyone can use it.
// Bearer Token - security token, any user with this can use it to access data resources.
// Basic Auth - username and password
// Digest Token - back and forth request for data, access, username/password, etc... (nonce and realm values).
